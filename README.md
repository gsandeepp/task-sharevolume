Your assigned company: Citizens Financial Group (CFG), CIK 0000759944.

Fetch https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyconcept/CIK0000759944/dei/EntityCommonStockSharesOutstanding.json (set a descriptive User-Agent per SEC guidance).
Read `.entityName`. Filter `.units.shares[]` for entries whose `fy` > "2020" and
includes a numeric `val`.
Save `data.json` with this structure:
`{"entityName": "Citizens Financial Group", "max": {"val": ..., "fy": ...}, "min": {"val": ..., "fy": ...}}`
where `max` and `min` refer to the highest and lowest `.val`. Break ties however you like.

Render a visually appealing `index.html` where:
- `<title>` and `<h1>` must include the live `entityName`.
- The max/min figures are clearly marked with these IDs:
  `share-entity-name`,
  `share-max-value`, `share-max-fy`,
  `share-min-value`, `share-min-fy`.

If the page is opened as `index.html?CIK=0001018724` (or any other 10-digit CIK),
`fetch()` from the SEC endpoint for that CIK using any proxy, e.g. AIPipe,
replace every ID listed above and the title and H1 without reloading the page.

Also commit the attachment uid.txt as-is.
